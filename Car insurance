In this project we analysed the insurance payments for the cars which they had accedents.
The database has the following tables:
PERSON (driver-id, name, address)
CAR (license, model, year)
ACCIDENT (report-number, date, location)
OWNS (driver-id, license)
PARTICIPATION (driver-id, report-number, damage-amount)

1)  The total number of people who owned cars that were involved in accidents so far in 2023 is.

SELECT COUNT(Driver_ID)
From Person
Join PARTICIPATION PT on P.driver_ID=PT.driver_ID
Where PT.report_number in (select  report_number from Accident where YEAR(DATE)=2023)


2)  The number of accidents in which the cars belonging to “Vincent” were 
involved is: 

SELECT Count(*) from ACCIDENTS 
Join PARTICIPATION PT on A. report_number=PT. report_number
Where PT.driver_ID in (Select P.Driver_ID from Person where P.Name = “Vincent”)


3) Delete the Toyota belonging to "John" since his insurAnce for Toyota has paid out: 
Delete From CARS 
WHERE License = (SELECT C.License from cars C
                                join  Owns O on O.License=C.License
                                Join Person PE On PE.driver_ID=O.driver_ID
                                Where C.model=”Toyota” and  PE.name = “John”)

4) Find the top 5 damages amount paid out last year. Show Driver info, report 
number and license appropriately.

Select pa.driver-id, pa.report-number, pa.damage-amount, p.name, p.address, O.license
FROM Participation Pa
Join OWNS O ON PA.Driver_ID=O.driver_ID
JOIN person p on  pa.Driver_ID=p.driver_ID
Join accident a ON pa.report_number=a.report_number
Where year(a.date)=Year(Currentdate())-1
Order by pa.damage_amount desc 
Limit 5
